      paragraph tag : The <p> tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It is a container tag and is used to group together a block of related text content, such as a paragraph, list of items, or other similar content. 
      
      the <p> tag is a block-level element that creates a new paragraph. By default, block-level elements take up the entire width of their container and start on a new line after the preceding element. So, when we use multiple <p> tags, the text will be automatically separated into different paragraphs and displayed on separate lines. -->

    <!-- page layout techniques
    using semantic tags for layout: Semantic tags were introduced in HTML5, which was released in 2014. HTML5 introduced several new semantic tags, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>, which are designed to provide additional meaning and context to the content of a webpage. semantic tags play a big role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) because they help search engines to understand the content and structure of a webpage. Semantic tags provide additional meaning and context to the content, which makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content of the page.  -->

    <!-- header tag(=>nav tag) :the <header> tag is used to define the header section of a webpage. This is the section that typically appears at the top of the page and may contain the website's logo, navigation menu, and other important information.

    the <nav> tag is used to define a section of a webpage that contains navigation links. This is typically used for menus that allow users to navigate to different pages or sections of a website.  -->

    <!-- In this given example, we have a header with a background image and a navigation menu. The <nav> tag is used to indicate that this section contains navigation links, and the <ul> and <li> tags are used to create an unordered list of links.
