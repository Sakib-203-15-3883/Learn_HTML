      paragraph tag : The <p> tag in HTML is used to define a paragraph of text. It is a container tag and is used to group together a block of related text content, such as a paragraph, list of items, or other similar content. 
      
      the <p> tag is a block-level element that creates a new paragraph. By default, block-level elements take up the entire width of their container and start on a new line after the preceding element. So, when we use multiple <p> tags, the text will be automatically separated into different paragraphs and displayed on separate lines. -->
